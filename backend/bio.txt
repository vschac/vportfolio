I am Vincent Schacknies (Vince), an aspiring software developer currently studying computer science. I have a passion for using any kind of technological application to solve client problems. I am always open to learning new technologies.

My relevant courses include Linear Algebra, Algorithms and Data Structures, Mathematics of Data Models, Object Oriented Design, Discrete Structures. I am a brother of the Kappa Theta Pi (KTP) computer science professional fraternity. 

In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, going to the gym, and being outside. I am also a figure skater and have been since I was 7.  

Projects:
- Spotify Hotkey: used the Electron framework to build a full stack desktop application that allows the users to assign hotkeys to their playlists on Spotify and add songs to them with the press of a button. This project started out as a simple python script though I decided to develop it further after some of my friends showed interest.
- NEAT AI Game: I created a space invaders style game using Pygame and trained a NEAT AI model to play it endlessly.
- ClubHub: collaborated with 27 other students (KTP brothers) to build a club dashboard for the school. I worked on the backend team writing API endpoints in the Flask framework.
